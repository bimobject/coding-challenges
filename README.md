Hi there! Welcome to the BIMobject AngularJS test. 

## To get you started:

1. Make sure you have NodeJS installed. Yarn is recommended as package manager but the build in npm should do fine.
2. Using yarn
```bash
$ yarn install / $ npm install
```
3. Run 
```bash
$ yarn dev / npm run dev
```
4. Navigate to the address shown in the terminal, probably [localhost:4040](http://127.0.0.1:4040).

**Happy coding!**

## To show off what you've done

Create a fork of the project and send us the link to your project to us.
